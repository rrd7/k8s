OPA is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enabled unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.
- not k8s specific
- works with json/yamlin k8s it uses admission controllers
- rego language
- does not know the concepts like pods and deployments

opa gatekeeper uses OPA by creating Custom Resource Definition.

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/release-3.5/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml
package main

deny[msg]{
    x > y
    y = 41
    x = 42
}

Rego is not a general purpose language. Its just for quering data.


deny[msg]{
    input.kind == "Deployment" #true
    not input.spec.selector.matchLabels.app #false as it is there
    msg = "Containers must have labels"
}

All the expressions are and ed together.

required := {key | input.container.securityContext[key]}

policy 1 = one one volume
policy 2 = only /flag directory
policy 3 = only hostpath volume should be allowed
