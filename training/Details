Controller
    - Node controller - checks the status of the nodes every 5 seconds, a node is marked unreachable after every 40 seconds
    - Replication controller
    - Deployment controller
    - ALl other controllers
    - Controller is the brain in the cluster, Kube-controller manager is the one which is installed

Scheduler only decides which pods goes on which nodes, but does not schedule it.
    - Filter out the nodes that do not fit the profile.
    - Ranks the nodes which are the best fits.

Kubelet requests the container runtime engine to pull the image and run it, then reports the status of the pods and notifies the kube apiserver on a timely basis.

Service is a virtual component only lives in cluster memory. Kube proxy is a process runs on each nodes, looks for new services, it creates the appropriate rules for each nodes.

Containers are encapsulated in a k8s object known as pod.

Services - NodePort, ClusterIP, Loadbalancer, nodeport - 30000 to 32767

Static pods:- Kubelet can manage a node all one. Configure kubelet to read the directory where the manifest files are kept. Kubelet periodacally reads the directory 
"--pod-manifest-path="path to the directory where static pods are kept"

Implementing encryption - The kube-apiserver process accepts an argument --encryption-provider-config that controls how 
api data is encrypted in etcd.
